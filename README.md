# EV Data Analysis

# Project Description
The EV Data Analysis[2000-2024] project explores trends, insights, and patterns in Electric Vehicle (EV) data. 
It aims to provide meaningful analysis to understand the growth, adoption, and challenges of EVs across different regions, using statistical analysis and data visualization.

# Features
- Analyzes EV adoption trends over time.
- Identifies top regions for EV growth.
- Evaluates the impact of factors like charging infrastructure and government policies.
- Provides data visualizations for better understanding.

# Tech Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, seaborn, 
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook.
- statistics & probability

# Processing:
- Data collected from Kaggle .
- Cleaned and analyzed using Python (pandas and NumPy).
- used statistical analysis to insights from data and visualized them through charts and graph

#CONCLUSION : 
Insights From Data :

1) Popular EV Manufacturers Insight:
Identify the top manufacturers of electric vehicles (e.g., Tesla, Hyundai, Jeep). Tesla likely dominates with high-range electric vehicles like the Model 3, whereas Jeep specializes in Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).
Business Action: Focus on partnerships with top-performing manufacturers or promote their EV models in specific regions.

2) Electric Range Trends by Model Year Insight:
EVs manufactured in recent years (2022â€“2023) show improved electric ranges compared to older models.
Business Action: Highlight newer models with better electric range in marketing campaigns to attract range-conscious customers.

3) Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility Insight:
A significant number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) are ineligible for CAFV due to low battery range.
Business Action: Educate manufacturers and customers about CAFV eligibility criteria to promote cleaner alternatives and improve vehicle designs for compliance.

4) Geographic Concentration of EVs Insight: King County (Seattle area) has the highest concentration of EVs, followed by Yakima and Thurston Counties.
Business Action: Focus charging station infrastructure investments in areas with high EV adoption. Create region-specific marketing campaigns to target EV users in these counties.

5)Popular Electric Vehicle Types Insight: 
Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) dominate over Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in terms of numbers and range.
Business Action: Promote BEVs as the preferred choice for environmentally-conscious customers. Offer incentives or rebates for PHEV users to transition to BEVs.

6) Price Analysis (Base MSRP vs. Electric Range) Insight:
EVs with higher electric ranges typically come at a premium price (higher MSRP). However, certain brands (e.g., Hyundai Kona) offer good electric range at competitive prices.
Business Action: Develop cost-effective EV financing programs for customers. Promote models with the best range-to-cost ratio for value-driven customers.

6) Legislative District Impact Insight:
Some districts have a high density of EVs, indicating better adoption due to supportive policies or charging infrastructure.
Business Action: Collaborate with policymakers in underperforming districts to promote EV adoption via subsidies, tax incentives, or improved infrastructure.

7) Electric Utility Coverage Insight:
Some utilities, such as "PUGET SOUND ENERGY INC" and "CITY OF SEATTLE," cater to multiple regions with EV support, whereas others are localized.
Business Action: Partner with dominant electric utility providers to improve EV charging availability and reliability in underserved regions.

8) Vehicle Location Insights Insight:
Geographic clustering of vehicle locations highlights urban areas as primary hubs for EV adoption.
Business Action: Prioritize EV dealerships and charging station placements in urban clusters. Provide mobile charging solutions in rural areas to encourage EV adoption.

9) EV Adoption by Postal Code Insight:
Certain postal codes show higher EV registrations, correlating with higher income levels and eco-conscious populations.
Business Action: Use targeted advertising in these postal codes. Offer referral bonuses to existing EV owners in these regions to attract more customers.
